## Database Schema

### Contacts Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Contacts" (
    "Id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "Name" VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    "Email" VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    "Message" VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL,
    "CreatedAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Configuration Files

### appsettings.json
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=ismtcollege;Username=postgres;Password=your_password;Port=5432"
  }
}
```

### Azure Connection String (for production)
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=your-server.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=ismtcollege;Username=your_username;Password=your_password;Port=5432;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true;"
  }
}
```

## Local Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. **Configure Database**
